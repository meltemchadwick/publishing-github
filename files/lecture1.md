# Lecture 1: AI Basics for Central Bankers

**Course:** AI Tools for Central Bankers (2 hours)  
**Lecture:** 1 of X  
**Audience:** Central bank economists, supervisors, and policy professionals  
**Goal:** Build a clear mental model of what modern AI is, what it is not, and how to use it responsibly in policy and supervision settings.

## 1) Why central bankers should care about AI

AI is not a new mandate, but it is a new production technology for knowledge work. It can lower the cost of drafting, summarising, coding, and searching. It can also amplify errors, bias, and overconfidence if it is used without governance. Central banks care for three reasons:

1. **Productivity in analysis and communication:** faster drafting, clearer synthesis, better internal documentation.
2. **Risk management:** model risk, operational risk, confidentiality, and reputational risk.
3. **Policy and supervision relevance:** AI is changing the private sector, including credit allocation, payment systems, and risk management tools.

## 2) A simple taxonomy of AI

### 2.1 Artificial intelligence (AI)
A broad term for systems that perform tasks that usually require human intelligence, such as perception, prediction, and language.

### 2.2 Machine learning (ML)
A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.  
Examples: credit scoring models, fraud detection, forecasting models.

### 2.3 Deep learning
A subset of ML using neural networks with many layers. It performs well in areas like speech, images, and language.

### 2.4 Generative AI
Models that generate text, images, code, audio, or other content.  
Examples: drafting a briefing note, proposing code, summarising a paper.

**Key point:** Generative AI is often a language and pattern engine, not a truth engine.

## 3) What a modern language model is doing

A large language model (LLM) is trained to predict the next token (a piece of a word) given the previous tokens. Through training on large text corpora, the model learns statistical regularities of language and of the content embedded in that language.

### 3.1 Why it can feel intelligent
- It can produce fluent, coherent text.
- It can follow instructions reasonably well.
- It can mimic styles and formats.
- It can generalise across domains.

### 3.2 Why it can be wrong even when confident
- It optimises for plausible continuation, not verified truth.
- It may fill gaps with invented details.
- It may cite s
